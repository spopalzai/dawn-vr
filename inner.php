            <p>In this image, Ameer Hussain takes us for a spin around the shoreline in Machar Colony, which is strewn with garbage. The 10-year-old boy studies at a madrassah and helps out with housework at home.</p>

            <p>In the last 20-25 years, it is believed Machar Colony has been raised eight to 10 feet. This is because without a proper drainage system and choked gutters, the streets and houses are inundated with water whenever it rains.</p>

            <p>“The biggest issue in this area is water. Where does stagnant water go? If there was a proper sewerage system, the roads would be fixed and rainwater would be drained,” says Parvez Akhtar, the field programme manager and communication coordinator at Imkaan – a non-profit organisation working in the colony.</p>
